Procedure to bring up torpedo/markers:
1. Have mechanical team make a torpedo marker device with a dynamixel inserted
  - Note it does not need to be fully assembled, just enough to have the cam attached for setting home
  - It is recommened that it not be fully assmebled so that the cam can be removed and flipped 180 if required
2. Connect the dynamixel to the actuator board
  - WARNING! ENSURE WIRING/POLARITY IS CORRECT!!! LIKE ACTUALLY DOUBLE CHECK IT!
    The team killed 2 dynamixels during the first bringup as the first one had reverse polarity, and the second received
    12V into the data pin. They are *very* sensitive to incorrect wiring
  - Also ensure that there is a 3.3-5V level shifter between the RP2040 and the dynamixel. The communication is bidirectional
    and the dynamixel *will* respond at a 5V logic level
3. Assign the Dynamixel ID from the default of 1 to the torpedo/marker id (2 at this time of writing)
  - Using canmore cli, issue the '@dynwrite 1 7 u8 2' command to write the ID register of dynamixel 1 to 2
  - If multiple servos are chained together, you MUST disconnect any unprogrammed servos, as there can only be one
    servo with a given ID on the bus at any point in time. Note that dynamixels come from the factory with the ID of 1
  - This is why the torpedo/marker ID is 2, rather than the default of 1, to allow new dynamixels to be added into the
    chain, without needing to shuffle around ids during the process.
4. Connect to actuator board over ROS, ensure the torpedo marker dynamixel is detected
  - The /<robot>/state/actuator/dynamixel topic reports all of the dynamixels known to firmware, ensure that a message
    with the ID assigned to the dynamixel is publishing
5. Move the shaft until the cam is in the home position
6. Set the dynamixel home position.
  - Dynamixels allow their "home" position to be set, which adds/subtracts the true dynamixel orientation by this amount
  - This allows the zero position to be specified for the servo, as this location changes for each torpedo marker
  - However, this offset can only be changed by +/- 90 degrees. This means that each torpedo/marker actuator has
    one valid position that the cam can be homed, and the other cam orientation will be out of range for homing
  - When homing the actuator, if an error of "Homing offset too large" is sent, this means that the offset is out of the
    allowed +/- 90 degree offset allowed by the servo. The cam will need to be removed and rotated 180 degrees, and the
    homed at that orientation. One of these two orientations should succeed.
  - The torpedo can be homed by calling the /<robot>/command/actuator/torpedo_marker/set_home service. Note the actuator must
    be disarmed when calling this (and should probably be disarmed while moving it so it won't try to hold position)
7. Verify the home position
  - Rotate the cam into a position not near the home position
  - Arm the torpedo marker with the /<robot>/command/actuator/arm service call, setting the boolean to true
  - Call the /<robot>/command/actuator/torpedo_marker/go_home service. This will move the cam back to its home position
  - This service call is also useful if the servo lost power during a torpedo command, as the normal drop/torpedo services
    will not move the servo unless it is in its home position.
  - Ensure that when calling this service, no torpedoes/droppers are loaded, as it is not gaurenteed the direction the
    cam will move
8. Test the torpedo/marker dropper
  - Ensure the actuator is armed and in the home position
  - Call the /<robot>/command/actuator/dropper service to drop a marker dropper
  - Call the /<robot>/command/actuator/torpedo service to fire a torpedo
  - To disarm, call the /<robot>/command/actuator/arm service with the boolean set to false
