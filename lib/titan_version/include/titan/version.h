 * The reason behind these release types is to know what type of code is running
 * a given microcontroller.
 *
 * The version (should) appear during a boot, so in the event of crashes or bugs,
 * it should be clear what state the code is running on it at a glance
 * (especially when using safety for crash reporting).
 *
 * The second is when communicating with ROS. In the event prototype code was flashed
 * to a microcontroller and is working with ROS, diagnostics can report a version warning
 * since prototype code should never be running in an actual environment.
