 * @brief Driver to allow for control of dynamixel servos.
 *
 * This driver exposes several functions to send commands to the servos, and installs background timers to poll for
 * connection with the servos and refresh servo state. This has an event callback, which fires on events found during
 * this background polling. Additionally an error callback is available to report any unrecoverable driver errors, such
 * as a requested command failing or internal driver errors.
 *
 * The dynamixel RAM and EEPROM reading is handled by this background timer, and available through functions to insepct
 * the dynamixel state.
