/**
 * @brief This is the id of the spinlock to use for ensuring only *one* crash is logged to the fault register
 *
 * In the event multiple crashes occur (on either core), only the first one will be logged.
 * This is done by keeping the spin lock unlocked until a crash occurs. Then, before writing the watchdog scratch
 * registers, this spin lock will be acquired and never released.
 *
 * Any further crash calls that try to acquire this lock will fail, and they won't write to the watchdog regs.
 * This will be kept this way until the MCU is reset (and when runtime_init is called on next start, all spin locks are
 * released)
 *
 * @note This should be the same as PICO_SPINLOCK_ID_OS1, however this header must be compatible with assembly
