/**
 * @file safety.h
 *
 * API for managing firmware safety/reliability related functions.
 *
 * This library has five main components
 *  - Fault Reporting: Implements a fault tracking system in a 32-bit ID. If a fault occurs, a bit will be set
 *      corresponding to a fault ID defined by the implementer in the fault list. A callback will be raised to indicate
 *      to the user that a fault has occurred (such as an LED lighting up).
 *
 *  - Kill Switch: Implements a set of functions to allow multiple kill switches to be assigned, which can be confiugred
 *      to require a constant update to remain enabled. Upon kill switch activation, an implementation defined callback
 *      allows the implementer to immediately respond to a kill switch request. Functions are also implemented to check
 *      the current kill switch state, and be notified when the system is enabled
 *
 *  - Crash Reporting: Hooks various parts of the low-level firmware to provide in-depth information about any crashes
 *      in the system to aid in debugging. This code hooks the systick handler to report an uptime, the hardfault,
 *      assertion, and panic handlers to provide crash information, and stores this information for
 *      SAFETY_NUM_CRASH_LOG_ENTRIES.
 *
 *  - Profiler: Records timestamps of various critical points in code to determine execution time for the various
 *      functions in firmware. This data is recorded and can be printed during a watchdoog reset and extracted during
 *      runtime.
 *
 *  - Watchdog Timer: All of these functions are integrated with the chip's watchdog timer such that critical code,
 *      such as kill switch updates, are never missed.
