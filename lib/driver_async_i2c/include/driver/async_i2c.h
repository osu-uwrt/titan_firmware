 *
 * @brief Driver to allow asynchronous scheduling of i2c traffic
 *
 * Commands can be built using the async_i2c_request struct, and scheduled to be transmitted with async_i2c_enqueue. One
 * of the tqo possible callbacks for failure or completion will be called in the future. Each command consists of an
 * optional transmit and receive phase, where one or both of the phases can be populated.
 *
 * Convenience functions exist to allow previously written blocking code to use this library without changing the
 * code flow.
 *
 * @attention hardware_i2c calls should not be used on a bus initialized with Aync I2C.
