 * @file bl_interface.h
 * @brief Stripped down interface for bootloader communciation
 *
 * This is an abstract interface which can be implemented by a variety of protocols, mainly CAN bus and Ethernet.
 * This allows for a single bootloader application to be built for a variety of protocols.
 *
 * Many features are removed from this interface, keeping only the essentials to establish communication.
 * Fault handling is also not considered in this application. Errors are only processed during init, where the
 * bootloader can exit without attempting any other communication. All other errors fail silently, as error handling
 * takes up space, and there isn't much that can be done as the bootloader. Instead we'll let either either the watchdog
 * or the communication timer time out and exit the bootloader.
